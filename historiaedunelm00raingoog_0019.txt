instance, he is to blame sor the deficiencies and impuri-
ties of his publication.

The imperfectioris of Wharton’s edition may be classed
under the following heads :—

lst. His numerous misreadings and mispunctuations
of the MS. from which he printed. Qndly. His arbitrary
emendations of his faulty transcript. 3rdly. His con-
densation into a few words of whole passages or para-
graphs. And, 4thly. His omission of nearly a full half
os the narrative of coldingham and GraystaneS, indicat-
ing his omissions with an occasiona13v„ but more fre-
quently giving no intimation whatever of the liberty he
was taking with his author or his reader.*

In proof of the first charge, the following instances are
selected from many hundreds which might have been
adduced :—

Wharton‚ p. 718. Cap. 1, “ Monachis aut Provinci-
alibus molestiam nullam retribuit3 nec ecclesiae possessio-
nes aut ornamenta contulit.” For retribuit the MS.
reads inludit, and sor contulit, abstzdit, (p. 4«†).

Wharton‚ p. 719. l. ⁶24, “ Quid sit moribus presulis
congruum.” The MS. for presulis conyrwum, reads
insemire plurimorum, (p. 4).

Wharton‚ p. 721. l. 16, “offam aliquam.” MS.
offim atim (p. ⁷>-
