of the Kiuges officers nor ministers can or may, be the Kinges

Lorde seaseth within hys liberti royall, as the King doth with-
out. As thuS, John at style, lord of the maner of Dale, witl1=n
Middlesex, and of the maner of Roke‚ lying within the Bisshop-
rycke of Duresme, is attenynted of felony or of high traison by
veredict of the commune lawe, like as the king in chys case may
sease the manere of Dale lying in Middelsex, soe the Bis-

within the said Bisshopryche, as it did in other laces without,

hym the saide maner as by his lettres patent theruppon made
