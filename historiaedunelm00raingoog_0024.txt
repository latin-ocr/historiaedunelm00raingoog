The various Records which are contained in the Ap-
pendix have been, with a few exceptions‚ which are duly
specified, procured from the Treasury or the Registry os
the Dean and Chapter of Durliam‚* and the facilities
which have been afforded for this purpose have laid the
Society under additional obligations to that reverend
body. In making this selection from many thousands
of recordS‚ care has been taken to print such documents
only as affect the general history of the See or Convent,
and especial regard has been paid to such as are alluded
to by any of the three historiens, or have a tendency to
illustrate their text. The whole constitute a mass of the
most valuable information‚ referring not ,merely to the
History of the Church of Durham, but to that of the
kingdom at large, and to every particular point which the
Society has in view in its publicationsxl· The first part
of the AppendiX, as far as No. xxr. p. xxx„ is occupied
by documents commencing with the foundation of the
Cathedral, soon after the Conquest, most of which are
new to the world, and all of which tend to illustrate the
narrative of Sumen and his CoN'rmuA'roa, as they are

ὓ In the Treasury are contained the original RecordS, and in the Regis-

, try, or series of Registers, transcripta of such of them as are of importance.

Our references denote either the number and page of the Register, or the

Box and Arrangement in the Treasury. In many instances both references
