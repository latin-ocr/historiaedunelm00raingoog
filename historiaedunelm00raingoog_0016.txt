by Wharton in his Anglia Sacra, 'in the year 1691,
with an 'intimatiom however, in his Preface,* that he had
not strictly followed his Manuscript, that he had rejected
useless matter, and had occasionally condensed portions
of his Author, for the sake os brevity3 but how far this
was done with the judgment of which he speakS‚ and
how far such portione of each historian as he actually
published were edited with fidelity, will appear in the se—
quel.†

In the year 1715, Bishop Burnet, in the Introduction
to the third part of his History of the Reformation,‡
directed the attention of his readers to the general in-
accuracy of the Anglia Sacra. ‘⁶ Ι have,'’ says he, “a

of the See. On this subject aee the xantth and ιθ chapters of his History,
(p. 120, δια), in which he speaks of himself and hie electiori and persecu-
tione with great modesty and forbearance. An engraving of the Episcopal
Seal, which it was ἰὼ intention to have used, may be found in summ.
Soals, pl. ΙΙΙ. Νο. 1. For further particulare ef hie history see Struma,
vol. Ι. p. xlv„ and Hurcnursou, vol. Ι. p. 284.

Of Caum nothing is known. Wharton’s reason for ascribing the third
History in our series to a person of thie name, resta upon the circumstance,
that in the Cottonian MS. the Narrative of Grayetanea terminatee with the
Life of Bishop Bury, which is stated in a note to be extracted from the
Durham History eff Wilziam de Gkambm, and as thie extract corresponde
word for word with the comment-emeat of the Bodleian MS„ of which he
and we make use, he not unreasonably supposes chambre to be the author
of the whole. This History ie more concise than the preceding two, and,
in many instancee, is not much more than an abatract of namoe and dates.
BesideS, ite author, upon more than one occasion, in characteriaing persone
of whom he ia speaking, bon-owe words aad phrases from coldingham. It
is probable that more than one person were concerned in this compilation.
