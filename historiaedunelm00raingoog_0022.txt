conduct os the Cardinals who had been robbed at Rushy-
ford, upon reaching the shrine of St. Cuthbert (p. 100).
These may serve as specimens of Wharton's numerous
omissions upon a small scale, as far as local history is
concerned, and the two narratives of the Raby stags (p.
74 and 110), and the biography of John Creping (p.
113), which are now restored to their places in Gray-
stanes’ history, evince the recklessness with which he
proceeded to indulge, upon a large scale, in his arbitrary
curtailmentS, at the expense of matter of an infinitely
more important nature than much of that to which he
gave a place in his peges.

The additions made to Wharton's edition of Cham-
bre, are neither so numerous nor important as in the
case of Coldingham and Graystanes, at the same time
omissions have been supplied, and mistakes have been
corrected. But a discovery os some importance must
here be mentioned. Since the notice respecting the
authorship of Chambre was printed (p. ii. above), a grant
of a corrody, by the Prior and Convent of Durham, dated
in the year 1365, to a person of his nameS, has been found,
and it is more than probable‚ that the individual upon
whom the important office mentioned in the grant was
conferred, was in reality our author. A person in the
full possession of his mental and bodily powers in that
year, might live to witness the commencement os the
succeeding century, and record its occurrences3 and it
is about this period that the history ascribed to Chambre

connect him with rainy weather—but there seems ιο be enough in the

above inundation, and its widely extending consequence& ιο makes general '

and last-ing impr-eonion upon the nation.
